# Monterey icons for Catalina 

macOS Monterey icons for macOS Catalina (auto-apply script)


## TO DO LIST

- [x] Update icons to macOS Monterey version
- [x] Backup and restore functionality
- [x] Fix the funny calendar icon in Dock <br>
 (Semi-fixed, it's no longer dynamic after applying the icon. Monterey's docktile worker doesn't support lower versions of macOS. Maybe someday I'll rewrite this one, but not recently. )

## Warning

To run this script, macOS SIP need to be disabled if on macOS 10.15+!

## Apply icons

Download the repo on your computer

Extract it and open the folder

Click on ``applyIcons.command``

It will ask you for your password to copy the files, enter it and all the files will be copied

It should create a Backup folder in the script's directory. 

## Restore

Click on ``restoreIcons.command``, grand it permissions and it should be back in good old style...

Make sure you have Backup folder generated and in its currect location.
